# Heartfelt

A game made for the Longgame Tech game jam.

This is a simple game made using the Racket language.

The code is clunky, but I could not plan ahead far enough to prevent this.

Included is the code used to generate the level data, deprecated code that could be interesting to look through, and any unaltered sprites.

The sprite sheets should be enough to get the resources, but some sprites were stalked on top of others, and may have transparency.
