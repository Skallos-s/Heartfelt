# Heartfelt

Heartfelt is an adventure puzzle game where you travel forward and backward in time to stop a science experiment gone wrong. There is some inspiration from the 4D puzzle game [Miegakure](https://miegakure.com/).

Originally made for the [Longgame Tech game jam](https://longgametech.com).

This game is made using the [Racket language](https://racket-lang.org/).

Included is the code used to generate the level data, deprecated code that could be interesting to look through, and any unaltered sprites.

The sprite sheets should be enough to get the resources, but some sprites were stalked on top of others, and may have transparency.

The code is clunky, but I could not plan ahead far enough to prevent this.

# Tutorial

Use the WASD or arrow keys to move around.

Use Q/E or Page Up/Down to change the time-viewing axis.

When viewing a time axis, the red side is the past, while the green side is the future.

The hourglass shows where you are in time.

Walk into an object to interact with it.

Press enter to advance to the next level or restart when you die.

Remember, walking through time consumes your life faster!
